  ## Maximum messages to read from the broker that have not been written by an
  ## output.  For best throughput set based on the number of metrics within
  ## each message and the size of the output's metric_batch_size.
  ##
  ## For example, if each message from the queue contains 10 metrics and the
  ## output metric_batch_size is 1000, setting this to 100 will ensure that a
  ## full batch is collected and the write is triggered immediately without
  ## waiting until the next flush_interval.

  ## Persistent session disables clearing of the client session on connection.
  ## In order for this option to work you must also set client_id to identify

  ## also set the qos option to 1 or 2 and don't forget to also set the QoS when
